Why Not use local computers/laptops to host the websites?
1) I have to keep my laptop/computer on all times
2) I have to make sure its secure all the time
3) I have to make sure my laptop/desktop is always connected to power and internet
For these reasons, we use servers:
Always connected to power and high speed internet
Special layers of physical security

SDLC:
1) BA collects the requirements from Client and creates software requirement specification SRS/BRS
2) Architects will create the software design document
3) Developers develop the code on local computers/laptops once once ready,
they run test cases and once all the test cases are passed they will request the IT department to deploy this code to Dev Server
4) QA will request IT or devops team to deploy the code on QA servers
QA will verify the change and start testing it.
5) If required, an application is delayed on performance and security servers.
6) Once everything is tested on QA server, application is deployed on staging server.
7) Once testing is completed on staging it will be deployed on UAT servers
8) Finally it is deployed on Production server

Jenkins picks up code from github, if there are issues, sends code to developer and sends email after each commit

Emails us and developer is there is a test that is not passing
